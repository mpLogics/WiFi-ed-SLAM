# WiFi-ed-SLAM

WiFi - ed(enhanced) SLAM aims at incorporate signal strength, time of flight and orientation information from WiFi and Bluetooth signals along with IMU data to enhance the accuracy and precision of conventional localization and mapping approaches by adding in extra dimensions of information. 

Furthermore, we also aim at creating a map of the simulated raw field strength and identify spatial features to aid in loop-closure.
